Gooseverse Escrow Smart Contract Secuirty Features:

Access Control using Modifiers:
// Define a role for the contract owner
address public owner;

// Modifier to restrict functions to the contract owner
modifier onlyOwner() {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can perform this action");
    _;
}

// Constructor to set the contract owner
constructor() {
    owner = msg.sender;
}

Reentrancy Guard:
// Define a mutex to prevent reentrancy attacks
bool private locked;

modifier noReentrancy() {
    require(!locked, "Reentrant call");
    locked = true;
    _;
    locked = false;
}

function withdrawFunds() external noReentrancy {
    // Withdraw funds securely
}

Pause Functionality:
// Define a flag for pausing contract functionality
bool public paused;

modifier whenNotPaused() {
    require(!paused, "Contract is paused");
    _;
}

function pauseContract() external onlyOwner {
    paused = true;
}

function unpauseContract() external onlyOwner {
    paused = false;
}

Time-Based Restrictions:
mapping(address => uint256) public withdrawalTimelock;

function setWithdrawalTimelock(address user, uint256 lockDuration) external onlyOwner {
    withdrawalTimelock[user] = block.timestamp + lockDuration;
}

function withdrawFunds() external whenNotPaused {
    require(block.timestamp >= withdrawalTimelock[msg.sender], "Funds are timelocked");
    // Withdraw funds securely
}

Upgradeability:
Please note that implementing upgradeability is a complex process and requires careful planning. You might want to explore upgradeability patterns like the "Proxy Delegate" pattern.

Gas Optimization:
// Use view and pure functions when possible
function getBalance(address user) external view returns (uint256) {
    return userBalance[user];
}

Event Logging:
event FundsWithdrawn(address indexed user, uint256 amount);

function withdrawFunds() external whenNotPaused {
    // Withdraw funds securely
    emit FundsWithdrawn(msg.sender, amount);
}

Third-Party Audits:
Engaging a third-party auditor is recommended for a comprehensive security review.

Whitelist/Blacklist Mechanism:
mapping(address => bool) public whitelist;

modifier onlyWhitelisted() {
    require(whitelist[msg.sender], "Address not whitelisted");
    _;
}

function addToWhitelist(address user) external onlyOwner {
    whitelist[user] = true;
}

function removeFromWhitelist(address user) external onlyOwner {
    whitelist[user] = false;
}
